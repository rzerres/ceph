ceph-mgr administrator's guide
==============================

Setup
-----

Create an authentication key for your daemon::

    ceph auth get-or-create mgr.$name mon 'allow *'

Place that key into ``mgr data`` path, which for a cluster "ceph"
and mgr $name "foo" would be ``/var/lib/ceph/mgr/ceph-foo``.

Start the ceph-mgr daemon::

    ceph-mgr -i $name

Check that the mgr has come up by looking at the output
of ``ceph status``, which should now include a mgr status line::

    mgr active: $name

High availability
-----------------

In general, you should set up a ceph-mgr on each of the hosts
running a ceph-mon daemon to achieve the same level of availability. 

By default, whichever ceph-mgr instance comes up first will be made
active by the monitors, and the others will be standbys.  There is
no requirement for quorum among the ceph-mgr daemons.

If the active daemon fails to send a beacon to the monitors for
more than ``mon mgr beacon grace`` (default 30s), then it will be replaced
by a standby.

If you want to pre-empt failover, you can explicitly mark a ceph-mgr
daemon as failed using ``ceph mgr fail <mgr name>``.

Calling module commands
-----------------------

Where a module implements command line hooks, using the Ceph CLI's
``tell`` command to call them like this::

    ceph tell mgr <command | help>

Note that it is not necessary to address a particular mgr instance,
simply ``mgr`` will pick the current active daemon.

Use the ``help`` command to get a list of available commands from all
modules.
